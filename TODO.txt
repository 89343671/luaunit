Notes:
- why isItemsEquals ?
- why _table_contains ?
- is_table_equals new implementation risks of printing inverted error message
- itemsEquals sorts tables before comparing them ? Side-effect ?
- assertIs should print the actual value and not just the type
- assertIs and assertNotIs are used for what ?


TODO:
- replace methodInstance with real test name in reports
- distinguish errors and failures
- better error display of assertIsXXX functions
- test failures path of output
- move all assertions together
- make all assertions use the errormsg function
- strip luaunit stack more intelligently
- control verbosity and output type with command line
- choose which tests to run with include/exclude rules
- more user documentation
- display time to run all tests
- make sure test suite ends when running tests with RunByTestClass or RunByTestMethod
- add assertAlmostEquals for floats
- add assertMatch for strings
- allow to skip tests
- add other types of output
- validate test output (TAP, ...)
- better error messages for table assertions:
	+ expected length of X, got Y
	+ keys differing in table 1 and 2

Nice to have: stack unwrapping like in py.test

Done:
x add assertContains for strings
x add assertIsNumber, assertIsXXX
x table assertions
x sequence asserts
x compatibilty tests with several version of lua
x add assertNotEquals
