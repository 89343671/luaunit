Notes:
- itemsEquals sorts tables before comparing them ? Side-effect ?

TODO v0.5:
- add travis-ci badges to README
- replace methodInstance with real test name in reports
- assert with matching of the error message
- more user documentation
- endSuite should make sure that endClass is called if necessary
- endClass should make sure that endTest is called if necessary
- check why endSuite is not called in output junit
- make itemsEquals non recursive
- better error messages for wrong command line option, or wrong output type

TODO:
- global setup / teardown
- class setup / teardown
- distinguish errors and failures
- test failures, verify that output is correct
- make sure test suite ends when running tests with RunByTestClass or RunByTestMethod
- add assertMatch for strings
- add other types of output
- add duration information to TAP and JUNIT output
- validate test output (TAP, ...)
- better error messages for table assertions:
	+ expected length of X, got Y
	+ keys differing in table 1 and 2
- allow to skip tests

Nice to have: 
- stack unwrapping like in py.test
- strip luaunit stack more intelligently: exclude content of luaunit

Done:
x control verbosity and output type with command line
x display time to run all tests
x move all assertions together
x better error display of assertIsXXX functions
x add assertContains for strings
x add assertIsNumber, assertIsXXX
x table assertions
x sequence asserts
x compatibilty tests with several version of lua
x add assertNotEquals
