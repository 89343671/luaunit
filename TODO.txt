Notes:
- itemsEquals sorts tables before comparing them ? Side-effect ?

How to run the test suite today:
- function name + function instance
- function name
- class name
- class name + class instance
- method name
- method name + class instance

What we want:
- list of names, each name being: function name, class name, method name
- class name, method name, function name
- class instance + class name
- class instance + method name
- list of test functions

func runSuite( [ list of names ] )
	+ collect all test names
	+ filter according to suite names
	+ pass to run suite implementation
end

func runSuiteByInstances( [ [ className, classInstance ], [ className, classInstance], ... ] )

func _runSuite( [ list of names ] )
	+ find instance for each name
	+ run it
end


TODO v0.5:
- add travis-ci badges to README
- replace methodInstance with real test name in reports
- control verbosity and output type with command line
- assert with matching of the error message
- more user documentation
- endSuite should make sure that endClass is called if necessary
- endClass should make sure that endTest is called if necessary

TODO:
- check how lua floats comparison works to improve assertAlmostEquals
- global setup / teardown
- distinguish errors and failures
- test failures, verify that output is correct
- make sure test suite ends when running tests with RunByTestClass or RunByTestMethod
- add assertMatch for strings
- add other types of output
- validate test output (TAP, ...)
- better error messages for table assertions:
	+ expected length of X, got Y
	+ keys differing in table 1 and 2
- allow to skip tests

Nice to have: 
- stack unwrapping like in py.test
- strip luaunit stack more intelligently: exclude content of luaunit
- choose which tests to run with include/exclude rules

Done:
x display time to run all tests
x move all assertions together
x better error display of assertIsXXX functions
x add assertContains for strings
x add assertIsNumber, assertIsXXX
x table assertions
x sequence asserts
x compatibilty tests with several version of lua
x add assertNotEquals
